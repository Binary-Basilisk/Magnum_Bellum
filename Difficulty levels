                                                  Difficulty level:
                                            (from most difficult to easiest)
                                                     
    Realistic: experience real war, if you get shot you WILL bleed out, and a single shot to the vital organs WILL KILL YOU.
                                  (warning, extremely hard, if you win, you are a god of war)
                                                 
                              Normal: You have armor, but be wary it's the first world war, not halo.
                              
                              Main character: You are a character from the movies, you have a health bar,
                      there is no pain tolerance level, and a single health pack will heal you instantaniously.
                                    (If you lose the campaign on this level you are a noob)
